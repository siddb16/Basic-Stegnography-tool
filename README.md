# Basic-Stegnography-tool
A python-bas tool to encode and Decode a message inside images using the least significant bit (LSB) method. I am creating this repository to enhancee my python skills.

***Project Name: Basic Stegnography Tool*** 
Purpose: This repository hosts a basic steganography (the practice of concealing data within other digital media) tool developed in Python. The project aims to strengthen my programming proficiency while exploring libraries relevant to digital forensics. Designed for educational and research purposes, it demonstrates fundamental techniques of data hiding and retrieval using LSB method.
